# Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `arr`. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of `1`'s in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of `1`'s you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return  *the array after sorting it*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
Output: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
Explantion: All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= arr.length <= 500
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 104

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortByBits(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        Integer[] nums = new Integer[n];
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
            nums[i] = arr[i];

        Arrays.sort(nums, (a, b) -> {
            int aBits = Integer.bitCount(a);
            int bBits = Integer.bitCount(b);

            if(aBits != bBits) return aBits - bBits;

            return a - b;
        });

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
            arr[i] = nums[i];        

        return arr;
    }
}
```
