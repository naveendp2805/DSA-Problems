# License Key Formatting

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return  *the reformatted license key*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'.
- 1 <= k <= 104

class Solution {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length(), c = 0;;
        s = s.toUpperCase();

        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();

        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; --i)
        {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);

            if(ch == '-') continue;

            if(c == k)
            {
                res.append("-");
                c = 0;
            }

            res.append(ch);
            c++;
        }

        return res.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
