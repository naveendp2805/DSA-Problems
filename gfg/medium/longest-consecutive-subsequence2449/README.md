# Longest Consecutive Subsequence

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  of non-negative integers. Find the  **length**  of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the **consecutive numbers**  can be in  **any order.** 

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The consecutive numbers here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6 numbers form the longest consecutive subsquence.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 is the longest consecutive subsequence.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [15, 13, 12, 14, 11, 10, 9]
Output: 7
Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, which has a length of 7.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int ele : arr)
            set.add(ele);
            
        int res = 0;
        for(int num : set)
        {
            if(!set.contains(num - 1))
            {
                int c = 1;
                int curr = num;
                
                while(set.contains(curr + 1))
                {
                    curr++;
                    c++;
                }
                    
                res = Math.max(res, c);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
